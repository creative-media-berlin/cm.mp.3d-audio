=======

This project mainly consists of the following.

1. [Main server](https://github.com/creative-media-berlin/cm.mp.3d-audio/tree/master/server-game-logic), which manages the data of all components and contains all of the game logic.
2. [Game-Master component](https://github.com/creative-media-berlin/cm.mp.3d-audio/tree/master/components/game-master), which renders a visual image of the scene and allows certain interaction with the game.
3. [Location tracker component](https://github.com/creative-media-berlin/cm.mp.3d-audio/tree/master/components/location-tracker), which tracks both of the players in the playground using two Microsoft Kinect devices and sends location data to the main server.
4. [Client Application](https://github.com/creative-media-berlin/cm.mp.3d-audio/tree/master/server-game-logic/frontend/player), which runs on the players smartphone device, tracks the players view direction and calculates the sounds from the server data.
